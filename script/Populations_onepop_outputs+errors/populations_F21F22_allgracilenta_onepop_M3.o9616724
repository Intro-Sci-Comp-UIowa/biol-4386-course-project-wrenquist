Processing data in batches:
  * load a batch of catalog loci and apply filters
  * compute SNP- and haplotype-wise per-population statistics
  * compute F-statistics
  * write the above statistics in the output files
  * export the genotypes/haplotypes in specified format(s)

Batch 1 

Removed 321239 loci that did not pass sample/population constraints from 322033 loci.
Kept 794 loci, composed of 113584 sites; 874 of those sites were filtered, 787 variant sites remained.
Mean genotyped sites per locus: 143.05bp (stderr 0.13).

Population summary statistics (more detail in populations.sumstats_summary.tsv):
