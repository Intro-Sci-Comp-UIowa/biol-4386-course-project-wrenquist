1. Relationship between M and n parameter values for the One population iteration. This graph shows how the number of shared loci increase as M and n also increase. The number of shared loci shared by 70% of the samples plateaus around M and n = 6, as indicated by the yellow line. M and n = 8 did not produce any results due to issues with missingness in the data.

2. Relationship between M and n parameter values for the One population_site specific iteration. As values of M and n parameters increase, the number of loci shared by 70% of samples decrease. M and n = 8 was not available due to computing errors with missingness. The number of shared loci plateau around M and n = 6.

3. Relationship between M and n parameter values for the Site specific iteration. As M and n values decrease, the number of loci shared by 70% of the samples decreases. M and n = 6 is where the number of shared loci stabilize, or plateau.
